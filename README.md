How To Import HYPE_Processing?
------------------------------
Simply add a copy of `HYPE.pde` to your sketch folder. That file contains the
"minified" version of all the classes found in the `pde/` folder. This means you
don't have to mess up your own sketch folder by copying 4 or so dozen files into
it.



HYPE.pde seems to be missing...
-------------------------------
If so, then it means that we updated our code but we haven't generated a new
`HYPE.pde` yet. If you want to still test the code, you can still do it by
copying the files in the `pde/` directory into your sketch folder.
