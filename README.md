HYPE_processing
==============================

A Code and Theory project / http://www.codeandtheory.com

maintained by Joshua Davis and James Cruz, is a collection of classes that performs heavy lifting tasks while using a minimal amount of code writing.

If you want to keep track of the changes, you could read the [changelog](changelog.md) for the latest developments in the code.


How To Import HYPE_Processing?
-------------------------------
Simply add a copy of `HYPE.pde` to your sketch folder. That file contains the all the classes found in the `pde/` folder. This means you don't have to mess up your own sketch folder by copying 4 or so dozen files into it.


Why is HYPE not a Library .jar?
-------------------------------
Since the addition of ProcessingJS into Processing 2.0 Beta, and the ability to publish to HTML using canvas... but the IN-ability to use external .jar libraries, HYPE was initially created using the .PDE format so that publishing to JavaScript was still a posibility.
