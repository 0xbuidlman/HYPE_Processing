.SS "\fBHRect\fP hype\&.drawable\&.HRect\&.createCopy ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Creates a copy of this drawable\&. This method is abstract and is meant to be implemented by the children of this class\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
A copy of this drawable\&.

.SS "void hype\&.drawable\&.HRect\&.draw (PGraphicsg, booleanusesZ, floatdrawX, floatdrawY, floatcurrAlphaPerc)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Draws this drawable\&. This method is abstract and is meant to be implemented by the children of this class\&. Also, this method is primarily called internally during the draw cycle and probably wouldn't need to be called directly\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIg\fP The graphics context for this drawable\&. 
.br
\fIusesZ\fP Indicates if z-coordinates are used\&. 
.br
\fIdrawX\fP The x coordinate where this drawable would consider as 0 
.br
\fIdrawY\fP The y coordinate where this drawable would consider as 0 
.br
\fIcurrAlphaPerc\fP The current alpha value in the draw cycle\&.
