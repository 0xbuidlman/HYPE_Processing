Sets the transparency for this drawable\&. The argument for this method can be any number from 0 to 255\&. Otherwise, if the argument is less than 0, the alpha will be 0; and if the argument is greater than 255, the alpha will be 255\&.
.PP
Note that transparency \fIis independent from fill and stroke color\fP, even if the fill and stroke can also have alpha values\&. And unlike fill and stroke, this transparency can be passed down to this drawable's children\&.
.PP
Also note that \fBHDrawable\fP actually stores \fCalpha\fP as a percentage ranging from 0 to 1 to keep the \fBdraw()\fP and \fBpaintAll()\fP methods a bit faster\&.
